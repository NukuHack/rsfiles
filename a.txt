i would like these buttons at the top :
"new" button creating a folder and if hold down for long then a txt file (if possible making a new file/folder will instantly go into renaming it)

make .ink files "open"-able so you can go to their directory

make the popup correctly placed and not make a black overlay to the files

make the popup have "Open" button to open with the default stuff

make the time function selectable

make the path open the file if it's pointing to an existing file (and even if there is no extension for the file)

make Shift clicking on something paste it to the path and if it's a folder just open it but if it's a file enter the path so the user has to press an enter to run the action actually

right-clicking the path would bring up a different menu with like Up,Back,Forward (default disabled only if the user used back will it have a meaning) and "open CMD here" and open recycle bin

pulling a string onto the path textbox with the cursor would past it into the path
and the user would be able to pull the path as a string out from the path textbox
